# 2D Transient Heat Conduction Solver Using Finite Difference Methods (FDM)

## Overview
This project implements **Finite Difference Methods (FDM)** to solve the 2D transient heat conduction equation using MATLAB. It includes:  
- **Central Difference Method (CDM)** for steady-state solutions.  
- **Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS)** for transient simulations.  

The solver models temperature distribution in a rectangular domain, supports geometric complexities like internal holes, and includes boundary conditions. It demonstrates numerical stability, convergence checking, and the impact of geometric configurations on heat transfer.
